What is JShell?

Java Shell, also known as JShell, is an interactive command-line tool introduced in Java 9 that 
allows developers to execute Java code snippets and commands directly without the need for a 
full-fledged Java program. It provides a lightweight and interactive way to experiment with 
Java code, test ideas, and learn the language features.

Examples:

1. Basic Arithmetic:

int result = 5 + 3

2. Variable Declaration and Assignment:

String message = "Hello, JShell!"

3. Defining a Method:

void greet(String name) 
{
   System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

4. Invoking a Method:

greet("Ramana")


5. Exploring APIs:

import java.time.LocalDate
LocalDate.now()


6. Lambda expression 

// Assign the lambda expression to a variable
IntBinaryOperator sumFunction = (int x, int y) -> x + y

// Use the variable to perform the sum
sumFunction.applyAsInt(3, 7)


In JShell, you can exit or close the JShell session using the following command:
/exit
