A thread-local variable is a variable that is local to each thread, meaning each thread has its 
own independent copy of the variable. This is particularly useful in multithreaded programming 
when you want to ensure that each thread operates on its own data without interfering with 
the data of other threads.


Here are some real-time use cases:

Web Applications:
In web applications, each incoming request is typically handled by a separate thread. ThreadLocal 
can be used to store request-specific information, such as user authentication details, session information, 
or any context relevant to the processing of that particular request.

Database Connections:
In a multithreaded environment, different threads may need to interact with a database. Instead of 
passing database connection objects between methods or classes, each thread can have its own database 
connection stored in a thread-local variable. This helps in managing database connections more efficiently.

Logging:
Thread-local variables are often used in logging frameworks. Each thread can have its own logger instance, 
allowing you to log messages with thread-specific context. This can be especially helpful in debugging and 
tracing the flow of execution in a multithreaded application.

Transaction Management:
In transactional systems, where multiple threads may be concurrently processing transactions, thread-local 
variables can be used to store transaction-specific information. This helps in maintaining the integrity of 
transactions without interference from other threads.

Security Context:
In applications with security requirements, thread-local variables can be used to store security-related 
information for each thread. For example, a security context containing user roles or permissions can be 
associated with each thread independently.

Thread Pooling:
When using a thread pool, each thread in the pool can have its own thread-local variable to maintain state
 information specific to the task it is currently executing. This avoids the need for synchronization when 
 sharing state across multiple tasks.

Global Configuration:
In scenarios where a global configuration needs to be accessed by multiple components, using thread-local 
variables can help ensure that each thread operates with its own configuration settings. This is particularly 
useful in situations where configuration changes should not affect other concurrently executing threads.

Context Passing in Frameworks:
Some frameworks, especially those dealing with asynchronous or parallel processing, use thread-local variables
to pass context information between different stages of processing. This allows each stage to access relevant 
data without explicit parameter passing.
