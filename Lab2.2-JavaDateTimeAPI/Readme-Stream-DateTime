The Stream API in Java 8 is primarily designed for processing collections of data. While it's not
directly related to date and time operations, you can use the Stream API in conjunction with
the Date and Time API to process and filter date/time-related data. 

Ex1:

In this example, a List of LocalDateTime objects is created. The Stream API is then used to filter 
the date times, selecting only those with a month value equal to 2 (February). Finally, the
 filtered date times are printed.

This is a basic example, and you can use various Stream API operations to perform more 
complex operations on date/time data, depending on your specific requirements.

Ex2:

We start with the current date (LocalDate.now()).

We use the Stream.iterate method to create a stream of dates by repeatedly applying the 
plusDays(1) method to each date in the stream.

We limit the stream to contain only the next 7 days using the limit(7) method.

We collect the stream elements into a List using Collectors.toList().

Finally, we print the generated dates. You can customize the starting date or modify the 
stream operations based on your specific needs
