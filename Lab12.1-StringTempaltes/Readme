JEP 430, String Templates (Preview), has been promoted from Proposed to Target to Targeted status for JDK 21,
a feature JEP type that proposes to enhance the Java programming language with string templates, which are 
similar to string literals but contain embedded expressions incorporated into the string template at run time.


Java developers can now enhance the language's string literals and text blocks with string templates that 
can produce specialized results by coupling literal text with embedded expressions and processors. 

The aim of this new feature is to simplify the writing of Java programs, improve the readability of expressions
that mix text and expressions, and enhance the security of Java programs that compose strings from user-provided 
values.




Run the example from command-line:

java  --enable-preview --source 21 TestMain.java

Note : it will not work from STS, shows error
