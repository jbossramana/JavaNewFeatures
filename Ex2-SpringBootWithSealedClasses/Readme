The advantage of using sealed classes and interfaces in Java is to provide better control over class hierarchies 
and enhance code maintainability and security. Here are some key benefits:

1. **Controlled Hierarchy**: Sealed classes and interfaces allow you to explicitly specify which classes or interfaces 
can extend or implement them. This control restricts the hierarchy to a predetermined set of classes, which can help 
prevent unexpected or unintended extensions or implementations.

2. **Enhanced Readability**: By knowing the limited set of subclasses that can exist, code maintainers and developers 
can more easily understand the class hierarchy and anticipate how these classes can be extended or implemented. 
This improves code readability.

3. **Refactoring Support**: Sealed classes provide a stable API. If you need to add new subclasses in the future, you can 
do so without affecting the external code that uses the sealed class. This is useful when you need to evolve your API 
without breaking existing code.

4. **Security**: In certain contexts, sealed classes can enhance security by preventing unauthorized classes from extending 
or implementing a sealed class or interface. This is especially relevant in security-sensitive applications.

5. **Error Reduction**: By preventing unintended or unauthorized extensions, you reduce the chances of errors or vulnerabilities
introduced by external, uncontrolled subclasses.

6. **Predictable Behavior**: The use of sealed classes helps ensure that the expected behavior is maintained. By explicitly 
declaring the allowed subclasses, you can provide a guarantee of specific behavior or properties.

7. **Easier Testing**: In unit testing, you can create mock or test-specific subclasses that conform to the sealed class's structure. 
This can make unit testing more straightforward and less error-prone.

8. **API Design**: Sealed classes are useful when designing APIs. By sealing your classes, you communicate your intentions about how
 the classes should be extended, which can guide other developers in using your library or framework.

It's important to note that sealed classes do not restrict the usage of the classes; they only restrict the extension of classes within 
your project. Other classes can still create instances of sealed classes and use their methods.

In summary, sealed classes and interfaces promote code stability, clarity, and security by explicitly defining and controlling the
hierarchy of subclasses and implementations. This can be particularly valuable in projects where a well-defined class structure and 
predictable behavior are essential.
