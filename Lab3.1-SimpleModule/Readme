exports com.module.simple;: This line indicates that the package com.module.simple is exported '
by this module. Exporting a package makes its types (classes, interfaces, etc.) accessible to other modules. 
In this case, any module that requires com.module.simple will be able to access the types in the 
com.module.simple package.

requires transitive java.logging;: This line specifies that the module com.module.simple requires the 
java.logging module. The transitive keyword means that any module that depends on com.module.simple 
will also have access to the java.logging module. This allows for automatic module resolution where modules 
depending on com.module.simple don't need to explicitly require java.logging.

requires com.example;: This line specifies that the module com.module.simple requires another module named 
com.example. This means that the code in com.module.simple relies on types provided by the com.example module.

provides com.example.MyService with com.module.simple.Simple;: This line declares that the module 
com.module.simple provides an implementation of the service interface com.example.MyService. The service 
provider implementation is specified as com.module.simple.Simple. 

This mechanism is part of the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI), where modules can provide implementations 
of services defined by other modules. Other modules can then discover and use these implementations via the 
ServiceLoader API.
