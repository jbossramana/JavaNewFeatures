Sealed Classes (JEP 409): This feature aims to enhance the Java language to allow classes and interfaces 
to be declared as "sealed," specifying which classes or interfaces can be subclasses or implementers.

In this example, we have a Shape class declared as sealed. The sealed keyword restricts the subclasses that 
can extend the Shape class. In this case, the subclasses Circle and Rectangle are explicitly permitted using 
the permits keyword.

The Circle and Rectangle classes are declared as final, indicating that they cannot be further subclassed.

By using sealed classes, we can control the inheritance hierarchy and explicitly specify which classes can 
extend the sealed class. This can provide more control over the design and usage of subclasses.
