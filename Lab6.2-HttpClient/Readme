HttpClient is a class in the java.net.http package introduced in Java 11 as part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). 
It provides a modern and flexible API for sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses. The HttpClient class is designed to 
replace the older HttpURLConnection API, providing a more feature-rich and convenient interface for working with HTTP.

Key features of HttpClient include:

Immutability:

Instances of HttpClient are immutable. Once created, their configuration cannot be changed.

Builder Pattern:

HttpClient follows the builder pattern for configuration. You create an HttpClient.Builder, set various options, and then build the final HttpClient instance.

Asynchronous API:

HttpClient supports asynchronous programming using the CompletableFuture API. You can perform HTTP requests asynchronously, allowing non-blocking execution.

Fluent API:

The API is designed to be fluent, making it easy to chain method calls for configuring requests.




HttpClient and WebClient are both used for making HTTP requests in Java, but they belong to different 
libraries and serve different purposes. Here's a brief comparison:

Library:

HttpClient is a standard Java library introduced in Java 9 for making HTTP requests. It is part of the 
java.net package.

WebClient is part of the Spring Framework and is used for making reactive, non-blocking HTTP requests. 
It's part of the Spring WebFlux module.

Programming Model:

HttpClient uses a traditional blocking I/O approach. Each request typically blocks the calling thread 
until the response is received.

WebClient is designed for reactive programming and is non-blocking. It supports reactive programming 
paradigms, allowing you to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Reactivity:

HttpClient is not inherently reactive. It provides a synchronous API for making HTTP requests.

WebClient is built on top of the reactive foundation provided by the Spring Framework. It supports 
reactive programming and integrates well with Spring's reactive features.

Integration with Frameworks:

HttpClient is a standard Java library and can be used in any Java application, but it might not 
integrate as seamlessly with some frameworks that are built around reactive principles.

WebClient is part of the Spring Framework and is designed to work well with other Spring components. 
It integrates smoothly with Spring's reactive stack.

Flexibility:

HttpClient provides a lower-level API, giving you more control over the details of the HTTP request 
and response.

WebClient is more high-level and provides a more declarative and concise API. It has built-in support 
for common use cases and integrates well with other Spring features.

Usage in Microservices:

WebClient is often used in microservices architectures where reactive programming is a good fit for 
handling a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.

HttpClient can be used in microservices as well, especially if the microservices are not built around 
reactive principles.

In summary, the choice between HttpClient and WebClient depends on your specific use case and the 
programming model you want to adopt. If you are working within the Spring ecosystem and want to leverage 
reactive programming, WebClient is a natural choice. If you are working on a project outside of Spring 
or don't need reactive features, HttpClient is a solid option.
