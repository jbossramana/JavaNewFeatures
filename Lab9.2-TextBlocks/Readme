Text Blocks: Text blocks provide a more readable and natural way to declare 
multi-line strings in Java. They allow you to include line breaks and preserve 
the formatting of the text without the need for escape sequences.

In this example, we define a message variable as a text block using the triple 
double-quote (""") syntax. The text block spans multiple lines and includes line 
breaks for better readability.

Text blocks preserve the formatting of the text, including leading and trailing 
whitespaces, line breaks, and indentation. They eliminate the need for escape 
sequences or concatenation when dealing with multi-line strings.
