The var keyword is used for local variable type inference, allowing you to declare 
local variables without explicitly specifying their types. Here's an example:

var list = new ArrayList<String>();


In this example, the type of the list variable is inferred to be ArrayList<String>. 
The var keyword is especially useful in situations where the type is clear from the 
right-hand side of the assignment, reducing boilerplate code.

Advantages of using var:

Conciseness: The primary advantage is that it makes the code more concise by 
reducing redundancy. When the type is obvious from the initializer, explicitly 
declaring it becomes unnecessary, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

// Without var
Map<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();

// With var
var map = new HashMap<String, List<Integer>>();


Flexibility: It allows you to focus on the intent of the code rather than the details 
of the types. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with complex generic 
types or long type names.

var result = someMethodThatReturnsAReallyLongTypeName();


Easier Refactoring: When you change the type of an object on the right side of 
the assignment, you don't need to update the variable declaration if you're using 
var. This can simplify the refactoring process.

// Without var
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();

// Refactored without changing the variable declaration
Set<String> set = new TreeSet<>();


It's important to note that while var can improve code readability in some cases, it's 
not suitable for all situations. 

var can only be used for local variables with initializers; it cannot be used for method 
parameters, fields, or return types.
