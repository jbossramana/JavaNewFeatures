The var keyword in Java is used for local variable type inference, allowing 
the compiler to infer the type of a variable based on its initializer. 

The decision to restrict the use of var for certain contexts, such as method 
return types, method parameters, and fields, is primarily driven by considerations 
related to readability, maintainability, and avoiding ambiguity.

Method Return Type:
=============

In Java, method return types are important for method signatures and provide 
clarity to the caller about the type of value they can expect from the method. 
Allowing var as a return type would make method signatures less explicit and 
could lead to confusion.

// Not allowed; it will result in a compilation error
var myMethod() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}


Method Parameters:
============

Similar to return types, specifying the types of method parameters is essential for 
clarity and helps users understand the expected input. Allowing var for method 
parameters could make method signatures less readable and make it harder to 
understand the input types.

// Not allowed; it will result in a compilation error
void myMethod(var parameter) {
    // method implementation
}


Fields/Instance Variables:
================

Fields and instance variables represent the state of an object and are often part 
of an object's public API. Explicitly declaring their types helps in understanding 
the structure of the object and ensures type safety.

// Not allowed; it will result in a compilation error
class MyClass {
    var myField = "Hello, World!";
}

# By restricting the use of var in these contexts, Java promotes code readability, 
clarity, and maintainability. Explicitly declaring types for method return types, 
parameters, and fields helps in understanding the code, especially in larger codebases 
where code comprehension is crucial for collaboration and maintenance.
