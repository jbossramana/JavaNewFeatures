The reason behind this limitation is that instance variables and fields need to have an 
explicitly declared type in Java for various reasons:

Type Safety: Instance variables are associated with the state of an object, and having an 
explicitly declared type ensures type safety during compile-time. This is crucial for preventing 
type-related errors.

Readability and Maintainability: Explicitly declaring the types of instance variables makes code 
more readable and helps maintainers understand the structure of the class.

Compatibility: Maintaining backward compatibility is important in Java. Allowing var for instance 
variables could potentially introduce breaking changes to existing code.
