Java 11 introduced an enhancement related to lambda parameters called 
"Improved Lambda Parameter Syntax." 

This enhancement allows the use of underscores (_) as identifiers for lambda 
parameters when the types can be inferred. This is particularly useful in cases 
where the parameter types are clear from the context, such as in single-method interfaces.
