Pure Functions:

A pure function has the following characteristics:

Deterministic: Given the same input, it always produces the same output.
No Side Effects: It does not modify any external state or interact with the 
outside world (like changing global variables, modifying instance variables, or performing I/O operations).

Impure Functions:

An impure function may:

Produce different outputs for the same inputs.
Modify external state or have side effects (like altering instance variables, performing I/O, etc.).
