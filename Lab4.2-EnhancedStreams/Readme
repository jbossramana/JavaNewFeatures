takeWhile and dropWhile:

		takeWhile: Takes elements from the stream until the given predicate becomes false.
		dropWhile: Skips elements from the stream until the given predicate becomes false.
		
ofNullable for Streams:

		Stream.ofNullable: Creates a stream containing a single non-null element, or an empty stream if 
		the element is null. This helps avoid NullPointerExceptions when working with streams.

iterate with a Predicate:

		Stream.iterate: Allows iteration based on a predicate. In this example, we start with 1 and 
		iterate, doubling the value until the predicate (n < 10) becomes false.
