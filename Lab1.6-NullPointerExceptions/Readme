Helpful NullPointerExceptions: Java 14 improved NullPointerExceptions by providing more detailed information 
about the null reference that caused the exception. It includes the name of the variable or expression that
was null, making  it easier to identify the source of the problem.
 
 The enhanced NullPointerException message clearly states that the exception occurred at line 6 in the Main 
 class and  provides additional information about the specific method (String.length()) that was called on 
 the null reference (text).

This example demonstrates how helpful NullPointerExceptions in JDK 14 provide more detailed information, 
making it easier to identify the source of the null reference and assist in debugging and resolving 
NullPointerExceptions.
