Importance of Modules in Java:

Encapsulation:

Traditional Approach: In non-modular Java projects, all classes are part of a single unnamed module, leading to potential 
encapsulation issues. Any class can access any other class.

With Modules: Modules allow you to explicitly declare which packages are accessible to other modules and which are not, 
promoting encapsulation and reducing the risk of unintended dependencies.

Dependency Management:

Traditional Approach: Managing dependencies in a large codebase can be challenging, leading to issues such as classpath 
conflicts and version mismatches.

With Modules: Modules explicitly declare their dependencies, making it easier to understand and manage the project's 
dependencies. Modules can also express transitive dependencies, reducing the need for developers to manually manage them.

Service Provider Mechanism:

Traditional Approach: Implementing service provider patterns required using external mechanisms or frameworks.
With Modules: Modules can use the provides and uses directives to declare and consume services, making it easier to design 
modular and extensible systems.

Improved Readability and Maintainability:

Traditional Approach: As codebases grow, it becomes harder to understand the structure and relationships between classes.
With Modules: Modules provide a clear structure, and the module-info.java file serves as a high-level overview of the module's 
dependencies and exports. This enhances code readability and maintainability.

Reduced Classpath Hell:

Traditional Approach: Managing a large classpath can lead to conflicts and runtime errors.
With Modules: Modules help avoid classpath issues by providing a clear boundary between different parts of the application, 
reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts and making it easier to reason about dependencies.

Security:

Traditional Approach: In a non-modular project, all classes have access to each other, potentially exposing sensitive functionality.

With Modules: Modules can restrict access to certain packages, providing a more secure environment by limiting the scope of 
what other modules can access.

In summary, Java modules bring a more structured and modular approach to application development, addressing many of the 
challenges associated with the traditional classpath-based approach. They enhance encapsulation, improve dependency management, 
and provide a foundation for building more maintainable and secure software.
