Scoped values are a new way to share data between threads without using method parameters. 
They also use less memory compared to Thread local variables.

Scoped values allow you to share data between threads in a memory-efficient way. They are memory 
efficient because the data inside a scoped value is immutable. This means that many threads can use 
the data without every thread needing a copy of the data. This is especially useful in combination 
with virtual threads. When running lots of virtual threads you will only need a single copy of the 
data for any number of virtual threads.
